If you're reading this, it probably means you want to learn how to make a requests with Hyttpo. Awesome! You've come
to the right place.

## Before you begin...

Sending requests is sometimes very handy, but you also need to know JavaScript. If you try this without knowing it, you may have unnecessary problems that take even longer to solve than the basic learning.

If you don't know JavaScript but would like to learn about it, here are a few links to help get you started:

* [Eloquent JavaScript, a free online book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [JavaScript.info, a modern javascript tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
* [Codecademy's interactive JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
* [Nodeschool, for both JavaScript and Node.js lessons](https://nodeschool.io/)
* [MDN's JavaScript guide and full documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Google, your best friend](https://google.com)

Take your pick, learn some JavaScript, and once you feel like you're confident enough to make a bot, come back and get
started!
