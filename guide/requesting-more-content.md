# Requesting more content

Since this guide is made specifically for the discord.js community, we want to be sure to provide the most relevant and
up-to-date content. We will, of course, make additions to the current pages and add new ones as we see fit, but
fulfilling requests is how we know we're providing content you all want the most.

To make a request, simply head over to [the repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/site/issues)
and [create a new issue](https://github.com/Garlic-team/site/issues/new)! Title it appropriately, and let us know
exactly what you mean inside the issue description. Make sure that you've looked around the site before making a
request; what you want to request might already exist!

::: tip Remember that you can always [fork the repo](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/site)
and [make a pull request](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/site/pulls) if you want to add anything to the guide yourself!
