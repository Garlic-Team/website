# Garlic Team Guide

## About

This guide is aimed at users who are either unfamiliar or inexperienced with Node.js and creating Discord bots. It assumes you have a basic understanding of JavaScript.

If you don't know JavaScript but would like to learn about it, here are a few links to help get you started:

* [Eloquent JavaScript, a free online book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [JavaScript.info, a modern javascript tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
* [Codecademy's interactive JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
* [Nodeschool, for both JavaScript and Node.js lessons](https://nodeschool.io/)
* [MDN's JavaScript guide and full documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Google, your best friend](https://google.com)

Take your pick, learn some JavaScript, and once you feel like you're confident enough to make a bot, come back and get
started!
